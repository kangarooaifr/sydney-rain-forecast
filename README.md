ML Rain Forecast in Sydney

The project has several objectives:
- implement an end-to-end MLOps pipeline
- implement ML monitoring based on a real life case
- perform continuous error analysis / model improvement
- educational approach (through a Shiny App)

The first step of the project is to merge / unify different components (data analysis, basic ML model,
prediction analysis) that were previously built as practical exercises and deliver them online through a R Shiny App.
At this stage, most components will keep their original state and performances as well as their manual inputs.

In a second step, I will work on replacing manual interactions by automated ones (model deployment, observation input, ...)
and initiate a continuous improvement process.
